# Cheesemaker

A simple image viewer using Python 3 and Gtk 3.

At the moment, Cheesemaker supports zoom, fullscreen, rotating and flipping images, displaying the images in grayscale, and resizing the image when the window is resized.

There is now a slideshow, which can show random images or show the images in order. This option can also be changed while the slideshow is running.

The save function is very basic - the quality of the saved image is not as good as it should be.

### TODO

* Display the correct orientation (according to image data).
* Put my feet up and relax.
* Provide more options when saving.
* Take it easy for a while.
* Add a crop function.
