# Cheesemaker

A simple image viewer using Python 3 and Gtk 3.

At the moment, Cheesemaker supports showing images (of course!), zoom, fullscreen, rotating and flipping images, displaying the images in grayscale, and resizing the image when the window is resized.

There is a simple slideshow, and the save function is very basic - you can only save the image with the original size.

### TODO

* Add a help page.
* Put my feet up and relax.
* Provide more options when saving.
* Add more options to the slideshow.
* Take it easy for a while.
* Make it faster.
