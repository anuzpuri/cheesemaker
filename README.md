# Cheesemaker

A simple image viewer using Python 3 and Gtk 3.

At the moment, Cheesemaker supports zoom, fullscreen, rotating and flipping images, automatic orientation, displaying the images in grayscale, and resizing the image when the window is resized. You can also open, and view images in, multiple windows.

There is no menubar or toolbar, but you can access the menu by right-clicking on the window. There are also keyboard shortcuts for most actions.

There is now a slideshow, which can show random images or show the images in order. This option can also be changed while the slideshow is running.

You can save images, but there might be a decrease in quality.

The preferences (automatic orientation, background color, slideshow time delay, and including images in subfolders) are saved for the next time you use Cheesemaker.
