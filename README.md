# Cheesemaker

A simple image viewer using Python 3 and Gtk 3.

### What's so special about Cheesemaker?

At the moment, Cheesemaker supports showing images (of course), zoom, fullscreen, rotating and flipping images, displaying the images in grayscale, and resizing the image when the window is resized.

There is now a slideshow, which can show random images or show the images in order. This option can also be changed while the slideshow is running.

The save function is very basic - you can only save the image with the original size.

### TODO
