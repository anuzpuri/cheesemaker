Cheesemaker
===========

A simple image viewer using Python 3 and Gtk 3.

At the moment, Cheesemaker supports showing images (of course!), zoom, rotating and flipping images, displaying the images in grayscale, and resizing the image when the window is resized.

There is limited support for fullscreen and the save function is very basic - you can only save the image with the original size, and you will not be warned if you are overwriting an existing image.

TODO
----

* Add a help page.
* Improve fullscreen support.
* Provide more options when saving.
* Add slideshow.
* Take it easy for a while.
* Make it faster.
